# just for fun

Trying out Unity to make some fancy smooth mechanics. However, behind the project was very dirty because I was just scratching the paper and only want to know how to apply the ideas.

Basically what you can do is:
-Basic platforming mechanics - walk (arrow/left analog), sprint (left shift/right bumper), jump (space/a button)
-Advanced platforming mechanics - hold jump button/key to jump higher, wall climbing, wall jump
-Aim (right mouse(toggle) + mouse cursor/right analog)
-Abilities:
force grenade (left mouse/left bumper)
inverse force grenade (left alt/right trigger)
teleport bullet (middle mouse/left trigger)
orb walk (keyboard e/x button)
gravity field (keyboard f/y button)
speed run (left ctrl/b button)
